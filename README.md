# Simple Platformer Game

This is a simple platformer game created for the Code in Place Final Project using Python and the graphics.py library.

## Game Features

- Character that can move left and right
- Jumping mechanics
- Multiple platforms to navigate
- Increasing difficulty with each level
- Score tracking
- Simple physics (gravity, collision detection)

## How to Play

1. Make sure you have the graphics.py library installed
2. Run the game: `python platformer_game.py` or `python simple_platformer.py`
3. Press SPACE to start the game
4. Use WASD keys to control your character:
   - A: Move left
   - D: Move right
   - W: Jump
5. Reach the gold platform to advance to the next level
6. Don't fall off the bottom of the screen!

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- graphics.py library (commonly used in Code in Place)

## Notes

I've provided two versions of the game:

1. `platformer_game.py` - Uses a more complex control system (may have issues with simultaneous key presses)
2. `simple_platformer.py` - Uses WASD controls with simpler input handling

If you have trouble with the controls in one version, try the other!
