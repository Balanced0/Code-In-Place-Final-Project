# 2D-Car-Racing-Game
This is my final project for Code in Place 2025, a fun 2D Car Racing Game built using Python. The game supports two players: one controls their car using the W, A, S, D keys, while the other uses the arrow keys. It features real-time physics and a collision detection system, allowing players to strategically block each other to gain an advantage. The goal is to complete 5 laps, and the first player to finish all laps wins. Building this game took a lot of time, but it was a fun and rewarding experience. I used five Python libraries to create it: pygame, sys, random, math, and pygame_menu.
